Encrypted Message Transfer with Python
This is a Python project that allows you to send and receive messages through an encrypted image. 
This project uses the steganography technique to hide text inside an image. The encrypted image can 
then be sent through any means of communication like email, chat, or social media. The recipient can then 
decrypt the message using this same application.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.5 or later
Pillow library
PyQt5 library

Installing
Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
git clone https://github.com/username/encrypted-message-transfer.git

Install the required libraries using pip.
Copy code
pip install Pillow PyQt5

Usage
Run the application using the following command:

Copy code
python app.py

Click on the "Encrypt Message" button to open the encryption window.
Select an image to use as the cover image.
Enter the message that you want to encrypt in the "Message" field.
Click on the "Encrypt" button to generate the encrypted image.
Save the encrypted image to your computer.
Send the encrypted image to the recipient using any means of communication.
The recipient can then run the same application and click on the "Decrypt Message" button.
Select the encrypted image that you sent.
Click on the "Decrypt" button to reveal the decrypted message.
